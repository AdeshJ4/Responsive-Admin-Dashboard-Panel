CSS Units


There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.



1. Absolute Lengths:

-> The absolute length units are 'fixed' and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
-> Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if 
the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

Unit	Description
cm	    centimeters
mm	    millimeters
in	    inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px  	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt	    points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
pc	    picas (1pc = 12 pt)




2. Relative Lengths:

The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
* Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw = 0.5cm.

Unit	Description	
em	    Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
rem	    Relative to font-size of the root element	
vh	    Relative to 1% of the height of the browser window size*	
vw	    Relative to 1% of the width of the browser window size*	
%	    Relative to the parent element
